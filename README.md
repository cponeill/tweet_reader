tweet_reader
============

This is a simple script that allows anyone to enter a Twitter user name in the terminal and see what their last 10+ tweets are. Again, the idea behind this script is pure simplicity and I am just using it as a way to understanding programming. Loading the script is easy as well. Just open your terminal, type in python, and then import te script. I think this script could become super useful if it allowed more in depth analysis and I would like to keep it simple. So here you go. Pure simplicity.
